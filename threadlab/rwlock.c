/* rwl implements a reader-writer lock.
 * A reader-write lock can be acquired in two different modes, 
 * the "read" (also referred to as "shared") mode,
 * and the "write" (also referred to as "exclusive") mode.
 * Many threads can grab the lock in the "read" mode.  
 * By contrast, if one thread has acquired the lock in "write" mode, no other 
 * threads can acquire the lock in either "read" or "write" mode.
